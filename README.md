# Zoonotic AI

This project is an implementation of the machine learning model described in the paper "An AI for an AI: identifying zoonotic potential of avian influenza viruses via genomic machine learning" by Liam Brierley, Joaquin Mould-Quevedo, and Matthew Baylis.

The goal of this project is to create a tool that can predict the zoonotic potential of avian influenza viruses from their genome sequences.

## Features

*   Predicts zoonotic potential of avian influenza viruses.
*   Identifies influential genomic motifs associated with human infection.
*   Provides a risk assessment of emerging avian influenza strains.

## Technology Stack

*   Python
*   TensorFlow / Keras
*   Scikit-learn
*   Pandas
*   Numpy
*   Biopython
